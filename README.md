# Python Games

Initially developed for fun over 12 years ago by me, with help from my younger brother.

Currently includes two GUI-based games: *Laser Chess* and *Door Maze Game*. Note that there is no direct connection between my version of "Laser Chess" and the pre-existing board game. I got the idea after seeing the board game in a catalogue, and then made up my own rules.

## Laser Chess

### Usage

#### 1. Install Pixi from Prefix.dev

Follow the instructions in [Pixi Installation](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/installation/) to install Pixi globally on your machine.

#### 2. Clone this Git repository

To clone the Git repository, ensure that Git is installed and then run:

```shell
git clone {pasted link from GitHub}
```

#### 3. Launch game using Pixi

To launch Laser Chess, simply open a shell on your machine, navigate to the top-level folder in your cloned git repository, and then run the command below.

```shell
pixi run laser-chess
```

Note: If you are running this for the first time, it should automatically install and setup the environment before launching the GUI.
